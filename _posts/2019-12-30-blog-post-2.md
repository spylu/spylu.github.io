I'm in my last year of undergrad and back in my hometown for the holidays. Even if there are times when I seriously regret not attending college in a warmer locale, it can be reassuring to know that my family (immediate and extended) is so close to my school. Studying at Davis has also given me a stronger appreciation for the Bay Area; it's such a vibrant, beautiful place with *significantly* better weather than Davis.

I saw a lot of old friends during this break, more than I think I ever have. It's at least partially because this is the first time I've been single and not dating around during a winter break, but I think we're reaching out to each other because we're curious to see where we've evolved toward. All of us are now in our last years of undergrad or our first year of working. Seeing their faces and hearing their voices, which are so familiar but also more settled and assured than they were during high school, has been really wonderful. It's a blessing to get to meet up with them and hear what they want to say.
