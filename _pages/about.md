### The Academic Stuff

Hey! I'm an undergraduate student at the lovely University of California, Davis. I'm in my last year of working toward degrees in economics and mathematical statistics. I'm also working on my senior honors thesis, which explores the effects of income inequality on household debt measures across a sample of advanced economies over the medium-run. I am broadly interested in investigating how real and financial variables interact. My email is spylu [at] ucdavis [dot] edu if you'd like to contact me for any reason.

### The Non-Academic Stuff

I'm Taiwanese-American with roots in Southern Taiwan and the Bay Area. I think a lot about how my parents did an entire timeskip from Third World living into modern development when they came of age during the Taiwan Miracle and then, more drastically, moved to America. I love reading non-non-fiction, cooking (my best recipe is coconut vegetable curry), hearing my relatives' stories about growing up in Taiwan, hot oolong tea, hip hop, and learning Taiwanese.
