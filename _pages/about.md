# The Academic Stuff

Hey! I'm a recent graduate of the lovely University of California, Davis, where I earned degrees in economics and mathematical statistics. While there, I completed a senior honors thesis that examined state-level relationships between income inequality and household leaverage. I am broadly interested in investigating how real and financial variables interact, how governments enable those interactions, and how those interactions impact individuals at different intersections. I am also interested in critical race theory, Asian American studies, decoloniality, and other areas of study that critique structures which we often take for granted.

# The Non-Academic Stuff

I'm Taiwanese-American with roots in Southern Taiwan and the Bay Area. On both sides of my family, I'm the first in two or more generations to be born outside of Taiwan. I think a lot about how my parents did an entire timeskip from Third World living into modern development when they came of age during the Taiwan Miracle and then, more drastically, moved to America. I love reading, listening to family stories, femme-created hip hop, and learning languages.
