Hey! I'm an undergraduate student at the lovely University of California, Davis working toward degrees in economics and mathematical statistics. Currently I'm also working on my senior honors thesis, which explores the effects of income inequality on household debt measures across a sample of advanced economies over the medium-run. I am broadly interested in investigating how real and financial variables interact. My email is "spylu [at] ucdavis [dot] edu" if you'd like to contact me for any reason.
